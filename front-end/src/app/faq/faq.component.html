                        percentage will increase by at least 20% by making sure that the student reaches up to his/her
                        maximum potential.

                        We do not take any tuition fees before or during the classes. You need to pay only after you
                        clear the IIT-JEE. We have confidence that all the students who are in our IIT-JEE batches will
                        be selected in IIT. So we take fees only after selection. We will teach you for free. You need
                        to pay only if you are selected, which is for sure!
